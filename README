App-sh2p version 0.01
=====================

This Perl script, and associated modules in the sh2p directory, 
attempts to convert the base syntax of a UNIX shell script to Perl.

It does not attempt to redesign the script for Perl but to assist 
in the conversion process by automating much of the tedium.

NOTE
This project is under development.  Feel free to use it at you own risk -
feedback will be welcome and should be sent to CLIVE@cpan.org.
